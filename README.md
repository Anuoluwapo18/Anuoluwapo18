# 👋 Hi there! I'm Anu

I'm a senior at the University of Massachusetts Boston, majoring in Economics and enrolled in an accelerated BA/MA program in Applied Economics. My ultimate goal? To make a meaningful impact as an Economist, exploring topics in economic development, trade, and public policy. Currently, I'm the president of the UMass Boston Economics Students Club and work as a Research and Communications Assistant at the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy.

## 🔍 My Interests
- **Data Analysis & Machine Learning**: Passionate about using data to solve complex problems, I’ve gained experience in Python, Anaconda, VS Code, Stata, SQl and Excel. I’ve worked on building AI chatbots and contributed to a team project at MIT, deepening my understanding of machine learning.
- **Economic Research**: As a research assistant to my Economics professor, I've gained hands-on experience in understanding how economic research translates into real-world policy. I'm excited about opportunities to further this work at institutions like the Federal Reserve Bank and similar research-driven organizations.
- **Advocacy & Education**: I’m committed to advancing education and advocating for women, which is reflected in my research work and community involvement.

## 🌟 Noteworthy Experiences
- **NASA MITTIC Finalist**: Led my team to develop the Mechana Glove, winning the proposal section and presenting our Mechana-Glove poster, which included financial and development plans.
- **Omicron Delta Epsilon Honor Society Member**: Honored to be part of this academic society through invitation by academic excellence.
- **Publications & Writing**: I’m an Opinions writer for UMass Boston Mass Media and run a blog with over 1,000 subscribers, where I share articles focused on enhancing economic education.

## 🌐 Current Projects
- **AI Chatbot for Nonprofits**: Developing a chatbot, using Python, tailored for nonprofit organizations to streamline their communication.
- **School Projects**: Gaining hands-on experience with datasets like [CPS](https://www.cps.io) and [FRED databases](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) for my Quantitative Research Methods and Advanced Macroeconomics classes.
